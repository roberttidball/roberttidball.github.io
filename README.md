[![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Live%20Site-38BDF8?style=for-the-badge&logo=world)](https://roberttidball.github.io/)

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, live at **[https://roberttidball.github.io/](https://roberttidball.github.io/)**.

This site serves as a central hub for my professional projects, technical skills, and latest blog posts.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Quantitative Developer & Data Engineering Leader with an MSc in Data Science & Financial Technology. I specialize in building scalable data platforms, automated trading systems, and AI-driven solutions using Python, C++, and cloud platforms.

## 🛠️ Built With

This is a clean, modern, and fully static website built with:

* **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, using CSS Variables for an easy-to-theme dark mode.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For smooth scrolling, scroll-based animations, and sticky header logic.
* **Google Fonts:** Using the 'Inter' typeface for a clean, professional look.

No frameworks or libraries were used, ensuring the site is extremely lightweight and fast.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Modern Dark-Mode Design:** A professional, tech-focused aesthetic.
* **Featured Projects:** Prominent showcases for my main projects, [FXMacroData](https://fxmacrodata.com/) and [SuburbStory](https://suburbstory.com/).
* **Latest Insights:** A dedicated section linking to my technical blogs on Hashnode, dev.to, and Medium.
* **Responsive:** Fully responsive design that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* **Dynamic Elements:** Subtle fade-in animations on scroll and a "glassmorphism" sticky header.
